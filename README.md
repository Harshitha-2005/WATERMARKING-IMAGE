# Image Watermarking using CNN and DWT (Python Project)

This is a Python project that hides a watermark image inside another image (called the host image). It uses two methods:

1.  **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)** – A deep learning method using TensorFlow  
2.  **DWT (Discrete Wavelet Transform)** – A traditional image processing method

The project has a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** using Tkinter, so you don’t need to use the terminal.

##  Features
- Upload host and watermark images
- Embed watermark using CNN or DWT
- View the watermarked image
- Extract watermark from DWT method
- Calculate and display image quality (PSNR, MSE, SSIM)

---

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow** (for CNN)
- **OpenCV** (for image processing)
- **Tkinter** (for GUI)
- **PyWavelets** (for DWT)
- **PIL / Pillow** (for image handling)
